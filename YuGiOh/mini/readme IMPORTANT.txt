What's new! :D

1. Card template colors updated to more accurate and vibrant :)
2. TOKENS added!
3. New preset layer styles added! (Secret Rare, Proxy, Proxy Gold)
4. MAJOR IMPROVEMENT on Type layer*
5. Easily convert your rectangular cards to cards with rounded edges!**

------------------

*The type layer looks 100% like the original now, but it's much, MUCH harder to use. The first letter of each word, the rest, and the spaces, ALL are styled differently, so you'll have to edit them carefully.

Not to worry: with just one run of this short tutorial, you'll get the hang of it.

For example, if I want to change Warrior to Spellcaster, I'd do it like this:
1. Select only "W" in the word Warrior
2. Change it to "S"
3. Select "arrior"
4. Change it to "pellcaster"

Winged Beast has a space in between, so if I want to change Warrior to Winged Beast:
1. Select "Warrior " (the whole word with the space after it)
2. Copy it, and paste it exactly after that space
3. Your text should look like "Warrior Warrior " (with the extra spaces)
4. Now proceed like in the previous tutorial to change the first word to Winged and the second to Beast.

(Similarly for Beast-Warrior.)

I know it's annoying, but trust me the result is WORTH IT. The cards look so fucking real, I'm sure you'll like it.

Big thanks to EagleOne for help with the new style type layer.
