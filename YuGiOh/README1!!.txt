REQUIRED

    Adobe Photoshop. This was made in CS6 but I think it should work for older versions.

    Very basic knowledge of PS. Most of the work is already done for you.



FEATURES

    Make every kind of Spell/Trap card in high quality, also built from official proxies.

    Multiple text layers available, already preset to accommodate larger amounts of text identically to existing Yu-Gi-Oh cards

    Every text layer is customizable

    Easily make any card gold foil just by toggling visibility for the layer group

    All fonts, text sizes, alignment have been checked to be pixel-perfect identical to real cards.
